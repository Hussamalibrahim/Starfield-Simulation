🎨 Technical Highlights
```
dx = (int) ((x / (double) z) * Panel.SCREEN_WIDTH / 2;
dy = (int) ((y / (double) z) * Panel.SCREEN_HEIGHT / 2;
```
📂 Suggested GitHub Repository Description
*"A Java Swing implementation of a 3D starfield animation, featuring z-depth calculations and smooth rendering at 60 FPS. Perfect for learning basic game physics and Swing graphics!"*
```
Timer timer = new Timer(1000/60, this); // Animation loop (60 FPS)
```

📝 Customization Options
Change star count in Panel.java:
```
star = new Star[200]; // Modify this number
```
Adjust animation speed in Star.java:
```
zSpeed = new Random().nextInt(2) + 1;
